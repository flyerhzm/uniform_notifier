UniformNotifier
===============

uniform_notifier is extracted from [bullet][0], it gives you the ability to send notification through rails logger, customized logger, javascript alert, javascript console, growl, xmpp and airbrake.

Install
-------

### install directly

    gem install uniform_notifier

if you want to notify by growl < v1.3, you should install ruby-growl first

    gem install ruby-growl

if you want to notify by growl v1.3+, you should install ruby_gntp first

    gem install ruby_gntp

if you want to notify by xmpp, you should install xmpp4r first

    gem install xmpp4r

if you want to notify by airbrake, you should install airbrake first

    gem install airbrake

### add it into Gemfile (Bundler)

    gem "uniform_notifier"

  you should add ruby-growl, ruby_gntp, xmpp4r, airbrake gem if you want.

Usage
-----

There are two types of notifications,
one is <code>inline_notify</code>, for javascript alert and javascript console notifiers, which returns a string and will be combined,
the other is <code>out_of_channel_notify</code>, for rails logger, customized logger, growl and xmpp, which doesn't return anything, just send the message to the notifiers.

By default, all notifiers are disabled, you should enable them first.

    # javascript alert
    UniformNotifier.alert = true

    # javascript console (Safari/Webkit browsers or Firefox w/Firebug installed)
    UniformNotifier.console = true

    # rails logger
    UniformNotifier.rails_logger = true

    # airbrake
    UniformNotifier.airbrake = true

    # customized logger
    logger = File.open('notify.log', 'a+')
    logger.sync = true
    UniformNotifier.customized_logger = logger

    # growl without password
    UniformNotifier.growl = true
    # growl with passowrd
    UniformNotifier.growl = { :password => 'growl password' }

    # xmpp
    UniformNotifier.xmpp = { :account => 'sender_account@jabber.org',
                             :password => 'password_for_jabber',
                             :receiver => 'recipient_account@jabber.org',
                             :show_online_status => true }

    # raise an error
    UniformNotifier.raise = true # raise a generic exception

    class MyExceptionClass < Exception; end
    UniformNotifier.raise = MyExceptionClass # raise a custom exception type

    UniformNotifier.raise = false # don't raise errors

After that, you can enjoy the notifiers, that's cool!

    # the notify message will be notified to rails logger, customized logger, growl or xmpp.
    UniformNotifier.active_notifiers.each do |notifier|
      notifier.out_of_channel_notify("customize message")
    end

    # the notify message will be wrapped by <script type="text/javascript">...</script>,
    # you should append the javascript_str at the bottom of http response body.
    # for more information, please check https://github.com/flyerhzm/bullet/blob/master/lib/bullet/rack.rb
    responses = []
    UniformNotifier.active_notifiers.each do |notifier|
      responses << notifier.inline_notify("customize message")
    end
    javascript_str = responses.join("\n")

Growl Support
-------------

To get Growl support up-and-running, follow the steps below:

* For Growl < v1.3, install the ruby-growl gem: <code>gem install ruby-growl</code>
* For Growl v1.3+, install the ruby_gntp gem: <code>gem install ruby_gntp</code>
* Open the Growl preference pane in Systems Preferences
* Click the "Network" tab
* Make sure both "Listen for incoming notifications" and "Allow remote application registration" are checked. *Note*: If you set a password, you will need to set <code>UniformNotifier.growl_password = { :password => 'growl password' }</code> in the config file.
* Restart Growl ("General" tab -> Stop Growl -> Start Growl)
* Boot up your application. UniformNotifier will automatically send a Growl notification when Growl is turned on. If you do not see it when your application loads, make sure it is enabled in your initializer and double-check the steps above.

### Ruby 1.9 issue

ruby-growl gem has an issue about md5 in ruby 1.9, if you use growl and ruby 1.9, check this [gist][1]

XMPP/Jabber Support
-------------------

To get XMPP support up-and-running, follow the steps below:

* Install the xmpp4r gem: <code>gem install xmpp4r</code>
* Make both the sender and the recipient account add each other as contacts.
  This will require you to manually log into both accounts, add each other
  as contact and confirm each others contact request.
* Boot up your application. UniformNotifier will automatically send an XMPP notification when XMPP is turned on.
